# OutOfOrder

Out of Order is an Android mobile app designed with the intention of tracking various metrics of user input and interaction during a period
of drug trials.  When opened, a user is prompted to create a name for themselves, which is added to a SQLite Database along with scores for
each of the two games within.


# Two Games Included

  ## Time Attack

Time Attack is a Whack-a-Mole style game tracking how many moles are able to be hit within a 15 second match.  After 5 successful hits, the
difficulty is raised by adding a second randomly placed mole to hit.  The idea is to track hand-eye coordination degradation over time with
the trials of new pediatric drugs.

## Memory Match

Memory Match is a card-flipping memory match game created with the intention of testing working memory over a period of time.
