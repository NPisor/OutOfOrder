each of the two games within.

Time Attack is a Whack-a-Mole style game tracking how many moles are able to be hit within a 15 second match.  After 5 successful hits, the
difficulty is raised by adding a second randomly placed mole to hit.  The idea is to track hand-eye coordination degradation over time with
the trials of new pediatric drugs.
